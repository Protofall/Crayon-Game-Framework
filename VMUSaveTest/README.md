# VMU save file demo

A basic demo that will create/save VMU files and also load them too. There is a compressed and an uncompressed version

The save file functions were borrowed from BlueCrab's CrabEmu, but have been modified abit to give an uncompressed version and use a struct instead of a file for the loaded save. The font is a modified version of wfont.bin from KOS's PNG example and alot of the graphics code and related memory code is lifted from Crayon
