# Basic sound effect example

This program exists to give you an idea of how to use the snd_sfx\* stuff. **Note that this not for playing music** look at KOS' ogg, cdda, etc examples which use streaming techniques (Note that if you use the mp3 library you might need to make your project open source due to legal stuff of the library that the mp3 port depends on)

The audio file included is the metallic sound from when Sonic Adventure 2 is loading a level (Its specifically from a Sonic Heroes Prototype :O ) I really really really really want to use this sound in this test so hopefully no one tells me I can't because I really like that sound :D
