The reason this example is so curious is that it behaves strangely on the lxdream emulator. If you were to compile and run this program you would be greeted by the IP.BIN and then a black screen. In the function "mount_romdisk_gz" you might notice there is a commented out "fprintf()" funtion, if you un-comment it and then re-compile instead you will be greeted with IP.BIN then the "fade.png" and "insta.png" will appear on screen as intended. This seems to be showing some flaw in the lxdream emulator since this doesn't happen on the nullDC emulator nor a real Dreamcast even without the fprintf() statement.
