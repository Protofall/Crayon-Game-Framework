Logos must be 320x90 maximum with 128 colors, in the MR format.

Sizious' IP.BIN creator can take images in the BMP, GIF, JPG and PNG format and converts it to the MR format.
	The background colour seems to be hex #C7C7C7

Also note there is an open source program called makeip, but there is no option for adding your own logo.

The .prt file is a preset file for Sizious' program to help speed up the process.

MrNeo says the logo should be located "32 bytes into the 1st bootstrap"
