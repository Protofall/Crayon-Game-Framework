# Audio example
This demo showcases how to handle both sound effects and music using the audio library powered by OpenAL.

Note: "The-Haunted-House.wax" is an original piece composed by Protofall in either 2011 or 2012. The license on it is basically "You can use this for anything, I don't really care". So feel free to use it to confirm your audio system works.
