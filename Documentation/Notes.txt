Part 1: Intro
Presentation is on Crayon, but need to explain Dreamcast as a part of it
Have a slide showing Current working Systems and planned systems in order from highest priority to lowest
DC, then computer (Based on OpenGL)

Part 2: What is the Dreamcast
Go into detail on Dreamcast. First few slide has specs, controller layout
Texture format is briefly explained here, but will be explained more later
Mention savefiles and the VMU screen briefly
Mention it had Internet capabilities if we want to use it

Part 3: What is Crayon
Crayon itself. Mention its a library made in C and is a 2D only game framework made by me
	- Depends on KallisitOS an Open Source library
Show the demo described in Issue #154
Mention its still a WIP, stuff is drawn directly to the screen without a "camera/perspective"
No current sound solution, but OpenAL looks good

Part 4: How a Crayon project works
- All projects have C code, an assets folder and a "Makefile"
- When building a project it converts the assets directory into a processed form called "cdfs"
- This is handled by a script called preprocess.sh, it goes things like make romdisks and converts PNGs to the Dreamcast's native format, DTEX

Part 5: Dreamcast texture format
- Explain that most PNG's are in 32-bit colour, RGBA8888. Explain channels
- Briefly explain the bits-per-channel conversion to make sense of stuff like ARGB1555
- Briefly explain how the PAL4/8BPP formats work
	- And how we can only have 1024 entries per frame
- Mention that there is a native compression format that can be lossless, but we'll rarely use it
- DC's main video-output is 640x480 Progressive Scan (4:3) with VGA
	- I feel the best game resolution is 640x360 which is 16:9 Letterboxed since it scales well to modern displays

Part 6: Testing methods
- 4 main ways of testing code
	- Emulators: DEMUL, REDREAM, Reicast, lxdream. Emulators aren't perfect though
	- Burn a CD, need to burn a new CD every time you rebuild program
	- Load via Serial/SD port. Just need to update files on SD card, but its *slow*
	- BBA. Send code over the network. Tends to be the fastest and best solution

Part 6: Distribution
- DC console isn't super common, but has an active homebrew community
	- Physicaly printed discs can be made, some people are setting the raw ISOs too
	- List some other DC game sales
- Talk about how piracy is inevitable and there's nothing much we can really do about it
- Its possible to do an "All-in-one" disc that works on Dreamcast, Windows, Mac and Linux

Part 7: Project examples
Talk about Minesweeper and Group16's game, but mention it can do more
